# DungeonmastersAI
I found myself making random stuff on the fly all the time, spending tons of time making arrays of taverns and npcs just incase my party wanted to find one. It was very time consuming so I thought "this is where openAI could help!" and I used openAI's playground to do this for a while but I kinda wanted a tool to do this I could run a bit more easily. And so this was born. Eventually I want to make some kind of module to pump into FoundryVTT to do this "live", but that's for a different 2 day fever dream weekend. If someone does that using this as a start - PLEASE TELL ME I WANT IT.

Its just a simple start at making a tool that can use AI to generate anything my heart desires on the fly.

Just download, make sure you have the right python modules, and run it.

I want people to take this and make it better, please! And tell me about your creations. I made this to make my life easier but I'm not even a python programmer, I'm a UX designer who codes mostly in JS and webdev. Why didn't I use JS? I asked openAI what would be the best way to do it, and it said pyton, and who am I to ignore my AI overlords?
